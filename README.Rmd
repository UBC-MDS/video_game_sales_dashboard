## Background

Electronic video games in 2020 generated a revenue of around $165 billion. To thrive in this competitive industry, video game companies have sales analysts who need to keep their eyes on stats relating to sales. 
Our dashboard can easily present the necessary stats relating to video games sales, by a user-friendly interface.

## Data 

The data used in this dashboard is drawn from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sidtwr/videogames-sales-dataset?select=Video_Games_Sales_as_at_22_Dec_2016.csv), which has 11563 observations. 

## Methodlogy

The dashboard performs exploratory data analysis by filtering several traits such as `Platform`, `Year_of_Release`, `Genre`, `Publisher`, `Developer` etc.
More in details in our [proposal](docs/proposal.md).

## Design

```{r design, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("Video_Games_Dashboard_Sketch.jpg")
```
